# enhancer-for-youtube-buttons-fix
A small userscript that fixes misaligned "Enhancer for YouTube" buttons after the YouTube UI update.

Works with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (subject to their userscript header feature support).
It'll probably also work with any other userscript manager you can think of... but if you know of others id expect you to know that already lol
